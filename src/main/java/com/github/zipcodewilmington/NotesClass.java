//    Implement Hashing Functions: You're given three hashing functions, HashFunctionOne,
//    HashFunctionTwo, and HashFunctionThree. Each function takes a string input and returns a
//    hashed value based on different criteria (first character, second character, or first two
//    characters). You need to implement these functions as part of each corresponding DashaMapX class.
//
//    Create DashaMap Classes: Implement three classes, DashaMapOne, DashaMapTwo, and DashaMapThree,
//    each implementing the HashMapX interface. Each class should have its own hashing function and
//            handle collisions by using linked lists.
//
//    Initialize Hash Array: Each DashaMapX class should have an array of Node objects,
//        initialized to a length of 26 (for each letter of the alphabet). Each array slot
//    will contain a linked list of Node objects.
//
//    Implement HashMapX Interface Methods:
//
//    set(String key, String value): Use the corresponding hash function to determine
//    the index in the hash array. Create a new Node object with the key-value pair and append it
//    to the linked list at that index.
//    get(String key): Use the hash function to find the index in the hash array. Search the linked
//    list at that index for the node with the matching key and return its value.
//    delete(String key): Implement a method to delete a node with the given key from the hash map.
//    This may involve removing the node from the linked list.
//    isEmpty(): Check if the hash map is empty.
//    size(): Return the size of the hash map.
//    bucketSize(String key): This method is used for testing purposes. It should return
//    whether a bucket (linked list) at a specific index contains a node with the given key.
//    Test Harness: Implement a test harness to read in a list of words from wordlist.txt. For
//    each word, insert it into each of the three hash maps with its corresponding integer value.
//
//    Node Class: Implement a Node class with fields for the key (k), value (v), and a
//    reference to the next node (next). This class will be used to create linked lists in the
//            hash maps to handle collisions.
//
//    Handle Collisions: When inserting elements into the hash maps, handle collisions
//    by appending new nodes to the linked list at the corresponding index in the hash array.
//
//    Handle Deletions: Implement a method to delete nodes from the hash map. This may
//    involve removing nodes from the linked list at the corresponding index in the hash array.
//
//    Overall, the goal is to implement three hash map classes, each using a
//    different hashing function and handling collisions with linked lists. These hash
//    maps should be able to store key-value pairs, retrieve values by key, delete key-value
//    pairs, and provide methods for testing the internal structure of the hash maps.

//    In the context of a hash map, a "bucket" typically refers to a slot or location in the
//    underlying array where key-value pairs are stored. Each bucket can hold multiple key-value
//    pairs, often implemented as a linked list or some other data structure to handle collisions
//    when different keys hash to the same index.
//    The bucketSize method you provided seems to be attempting to determine whether a given key
//    exists within a particular bucket of the hash map. Here's how it works:
//            * 		Computing Bucket Index: The method starts by using the hashFunctionThree(key)
//            to compute the index of the bucket where the key might be found.
//            * 		Traversing the Linked List: It then traverses the linked list at the computed
//            bucket index. This linked list contains all key-value pairs that hashed to the same
//            index.
//            * 		Finding the Key: Within the linked list, it iterates through each node to
//            check if any node's key matches the provided key.
//            * 		Returning Result: If a node with a matching key is found in the bucket,
//            the method returns true, indicating that the key exists in that bucket.
//            * 		Handling Key Not Found: If the key is not found in the bucket (i.e., the
//            end of the linked list is reached without finding a matching key), the method returns
//            false, indicating that the key does not exist in that bucket.
//    Essentially, the bucketSize method provides a way to determine whether a specific key exists
//    within the bucket of the hash map corresponding to a given hash code. It traverses the linked
//    list at the computed bucket index and checks each node's key until it finds a match or reaches
//    the end of the list. If a match is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
//
//
//
//
//            ￼
//    You
//    So essentially if you were to input two or more key-value pairs into the same bucket, it
//    then creates a linked list to hold those key-value pairs. Then checks that linked list of
//    key-value pairs in the current bucket and returns wether it is there or not? If that is the
//    case, then is it a boolean and not a number value?
//
//    ChatGPT
//            ChatGPT
//    Yes, you've got the right idea. In a hash map implementation, when two or more keys hash
//    to the same index (i.e., fall into the same bucket), a linked list or another suitable data
//    structure is typically used to handle collisions. This linked list contains all the key-value
//    pairs that mapped to the same bucket.
//    The bucketSize method indeed returns a boolean value, not a number. It's used to determine
//    whether a specific key exists within the bucket of the hash map corresponding to a given hash
//    code. If the key is found in the linked list associated with the bucket, it returns true,
//    indicating that the key exists in that bucket. If the key is not found in the linked list, it
//    returns false, indicating that the key does not exist in that bucket.
//    So, you're correct in understanding that it returns a boolean indicating whether the key is
//    present in the current bucket or not. The method is used for checking the existence of a key
//    in a specific bucket rather than counting the number of elements in that bucket.
//
//
//
//            ￼
//    You
//    Ok got it. But then my next question is if it is just returning wether a key-value pair is
//    present in the linked list, then why call the method 'bucketSize'? To me 'bucketSize' should
//    return a number value to indicate how long the linked list in the bucket is, not if the
//    key-value pair is present in the bucket. To me that would more of a 'bucketGetKey' method or
//    a "bucketCheck' method to see if the key-value pair is there.
//
//    ChatGPT
//            ChatGPT
//    You're absolutely correct in pointing out that the name bucketSize might be misleading based
//    on its actual functionality. A more appropriate name for the method could indeed be
//    containsKeyInBucket or bucketContainsKey, as it checks whether a specific key exists within
//    the linked list associated with a bucket, rather than returning the size of the bucket.
//    Naming methods accurately is crucial for readability and maintainability of code. Using
//    descriptive names that accurately convey the purpose of the method helps other developers
//    (and your future self!) understand what the method does without needing to dive into its
//    implementation details.
//    So, your suggestion of renaming the method to something like containsKeyInBucket would make
//    the code clearer and more intuitive to understand. Thank you for bringing up this important
//    point about method naming!
//
//
//
//            ￼
//    You
//    Youre welcome. I am just trying to understand exactly what this method does and how it is
//    implemented and how it is crucial to avoiding collisions in the linked hashmap. So essentially
//    what is happening is, we are created a linked hashmap with 26 buckets. Those buckets are
//    accessed via the Node. You then use the node to iterate over the linked hashmap to find which
//    bucket in the hashmap contains the corrent key-value pairs you are looking for. Then if you
//    find the bucket with the key-value pairs you are looking for, you then check in that bucket to
//    see if there is more than one key-value pair that share the same key-values the hashing
//    function uses to place the data into the bucket/node. That data in the bucket/node is a
//    linked list that is then checked with the bucketSize method to find the ACTUAL key-value pair
//    you truly want to find by the hash value. Is this a correct understanding of how this whole
//    linked hashmap works?
//
//    ChatGPT
//            ChatGPT
//    Yes, you're on the right track! Here's a breakdown of how the linked hashmap works based on
//    your understanding:
//            * 		Creating Buckets: The linked hashmap initializes an array of 26 buckets
//            (nodes), each representing a slot in the hashmap. These buckets are used to store
//            key-value pairs.
//            * 		Hashing and Accessing Buckets: When you want to store a key-value pair or
//            retrieve a value based on a key, you first determine the index of the bucket to access
//            by applying a hash function to the key. This hash function maps keys to bucket indices.
//            * 		Handling Collisions: If multiple keys map to the same bucket index
//            (a collision occurs), a linked list is used to store these key-value pairs in the
//            same bucket. Each node in the linked list represents a key-value pair.
//            * 		Searching for a Key: When you want to retrieve the value associated with
//            a key, you first calculate the bucket index using the hash function. Then, you
//            traverse the linked list in the corresponding bucket to find the node that contains
//            the key you're searching for.
//            * 		Using bucketSize: The bucketSize method (or whatever it's called) helps
//            determine whether a specific key exists in the linked list within a bucket. It
//            traverses the linked list, checking each node's key until it finds a match. If
//            a match is found, it returns true, indicating that the key exists in the linked
//            list. Otherwise, it returns false.
//            By utilizing linked lists to handle collisions and employing methods like bucketSize
//            to search within buckets, the linked hashmap efficiently stores and retrieves key-value
//            pairs even when there are hash collisions. Your understanding captures the essence
//            of how this data structure operates effectively. Great job!
//
//
//           OK. Thanks. One more question. The way I am understanding this as well goes like this.
//           Lets say there is a key-value pair and another key-value pair. In order to correctly
//           place those key value pairs, the hash function checks it characters at a certain
//           position. In this example it is at the first position. What this does is, checks both
//           key-value pairs, essentially the key which is a string, for the first letter in the
//           key. If that first letter in both key-value pairs are the same, they will both go into
//           the same bucket, and would also mean that a certain portion of the hashcode in both
//           key-value pairs is identical, maybe just at the beginning, which is how the linked
//           hashmap knows where to put the key-value pair and makes sure it is placed in the correct
//           place since we initialized our linked hashmap with a size of 26, one for each letter of
//           the alphabet. But lets say the first key-value pair and second key-value pair only have
//           the first two or three characters in common and the rest are different. That means that
//           thought the first part of the hashcode is the same for both of those key-value pair, the
//           latter parts of the hash cade are not. This is how the linked hashmap knows which
//           bucket/node to put the key-value pairs in, but yet also knows that though they may go in
//           the same bucket, they are not the same key-value pair. And when it does this, it creates
//           a linked list in the bucket to store those values. That linked list is in hash order or
//           alphabetical order. To me this whole thing we are doing strikes me as the same thing as
//           a dictionary. Am i right in this line of thinking I just asked you?
//
//           ChatGPT
//           ChatGPT
//           Yes, you're absolutely correct! Your understanding is spot on. Let's break it down:
//            * 		Hashing for Bucket Placement: When inserting key-value pairs into the
//            hashmap, a hash function is applied to each key to determine the index (or bucket)
//            where the key-value pair should be placed. This hash function typically generates a
//            numeric value based on the key's characters, with the intention of distributing
//            key-value pairs evenly across the buckets.
//            * 		Handling Collisions: As you rightly pointed out, if two different keys
//            produce the same hash value (a hash collision), they will be placed in the same
//            bucket. This is where the linked list comes into play. Instead of overwriting the
//            existing key-value pair, the new pair is added to the linked list associated with
//            that bucket. This preserves all key-value pairs and prevents data loss.
//            * 		Ordered Storage in Linked Lists: The linked lists within each bucket
//            maintain the order in which key-value pairs were inserted. This means that even
//            though multiple key-value pairs may share the same bucket due to hash collisions,
//            they are stored sequentially in the linked list. This organization allows for
//            efficient retrieval of key-value pairs when searching by key.
//            * 		Analogy to a Dictionary: Your comparison to a dictionary is apt. Like
//            a dictionary, a hashmap allows for the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.
//            The hash function serves as a mechanism for indexing and organizing the data,
//            similar to how a dictionary alphabetically arranges words to facilitate lookup.
//            And just like in a dictionary, where words with the same starting letter are grouped
//            together but remain distinct entities, in a hashmap, key-value pairs in the same bucket
//            are organized but maintain their individual identities.
//    In summary, your analogy to a dictionary captures the essence of how a hashmap operates.
//    It efficiently manages data storage, retrieval, and collision resolution, making it a
//    fundamental data structure in computer science. Great job on grasping the concepts!
//
//    Last question. In this lab we are doing they want us to create three linked hashmaps all
//    implementing a hashmapX interface with the methods that need to be used in order to put, get,
//    delete, check size, check is empty, and other functions required for the hashmap to function.
//    The only difference in the three different classes of hashmaps, is the hashing function. The
//    first function checks the key at the first character, the second checks the key at the second
//    character, and the third checks the key at the first and second character. On the hashmapX
//    interface, a method called bucketSize is present and thus implemented into each hashmap
//    class(hashMapOne, hashMapTwo, hashMapThree). In the interface, there is a note for the
//    bucketSize method that says it is used for testing purposes. Why and how and what does this
//    method test for each hashmap respectively? The way I understand it is that since each hashing
//    function does something a little different for each hashMap and each hashmap has its own
//    seperate hashing function, this bucketSize method essentially checks that the hashing functions
//    are putting the key-value pairs in the correct places and the linked lists in each bucket/node
//    of the hashMaps have the correct hash values and key-values pairs in the correct order and
//    correct places?
//
//    ChatGPT
//    ChatGPT
//    Yes, you're on the right track! The bucketSize method, as indicated by the comment in
//    the interface, is primarily used for testing purposes. Its purpose is to verify that the
//    hashing functions are distributing the key-value pairs across the buckets correctly and that
//    the linked lists within each bucket are organized as expected.
//    Here's how bucketSize can be used for testing each hashmap implementation:
//            * 		HashMapOne: This hashmap uses a hashing function that checks the key at
//            the first character. For testing purposes, bucketSize can be used to ensure that
//            key-value pairs with keys that share the same first character are indeed placed in
//            the same bucket. It checks if the linked lists in each bucket correctly contain
//            key-value pairs that share the same first character.
//            * 		HashMapTwo: This hashmap uses a hashing function that checks the key at
//            the second character. Similarly, bucketSize can be used to verify that key-value pairs
//            with keys that share the same second character are placed in the same bucket. It checks
//            if the linked lists in each bucket correctly contain key-value pairs that share the same
//            second character.
//            * 		HashMapThree: This hashmap uses a hashing function that checks the key at
//            the first and second characters. For testing, bucketSize can ensure that key-value
//            pairs with keys that share the same first and second characters are placed in the
//            same bucket. It checks if the linked lists in each bucket correctly contain key-value
//            pairs that share the same first and second characters.
//    In essence, bucketSize acts as a diagnostic tool to validate the integrity of the hashmap
//    implementation, particularly regarding how key-value pairs are distributed across the buckets
//    and stored within the linked lists. By examining the sizes and contents of the buckets,
//    developers can gain insights into the effectiveness of their hashing functions and collision
//    resolution strategies.
